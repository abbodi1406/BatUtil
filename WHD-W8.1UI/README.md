* or set extra manual options below:

warning: the process will consume very high amount of CPU and RAM resources

create new iso file, if the target is a distribution  
require installed ADK, or place oscdimg.exe or cdimage.exe next to the script

- ISODir  
folder path for iso file, leave it blank to create in the script current directory

* To restore old behavior and change options by editing the script, simply detele WHD-W81UI.ini file


## Remarks:

* How to perform the pending cleanup operation for online OS:  
- run WHD-W81UI.cmd and install updates, assuming you choose to cleanup OS image (with or without resetbase)  
- restart system  
- run WHD-W81UI.cmd again, it will go directly to Cleanup or Reset OS image (it doesn't install or check any updates)

* for offline integration, a simple script will be created on desktop RunOnce_W10_Telemetry_Tasks.cmd  
after installing the OS, you need to run it as administrator, it will be self-deleted afterwards

* WinPE images (boot.wim/winre.wim) will be updated only with:  
- servicing stack update  
- baseline updates  
- Monthly Quality Rollup  
- extra few WinPE updates

## Debug Mode (for advanced users):

* Create a log file of the integration process for debugging purposes

* The operation progress will not be shown in this mode

* How To:  
- edit the script and change set _Debug=0 to 1  
- set main options correctly, specially "target" and "repo"  
- save and run the script as admin  
- wait until command prompt window is closed and Debug.log is created
