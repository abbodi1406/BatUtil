* Installing proofing tools require using Office Deployment Tool Setup.exe with simple configuration xml file

* The generator script will create this configuration file (one per architecture)

* When you execute downloading script (Aria2, Wget, or cURL), it will move the config file(s) into the downloaded "Office" folder

* Then, to install the proofing tools, run command prompt as administrator, and execute the following command as an example:  
Setup.exe /configure config_file.xml

replace config_file.xml with the complete path for the config file inside Office folder
