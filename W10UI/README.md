# Windows NT 10.0 Updates Installer

Automated script to install or integrate updates for:  
- Windows 10
- Windows 11
- Windows Server 2016, 2019, 2022

## Features:

* Supported targets:  
> Current Online OS  
Offline image (already mounted directory, another partition)  
Distribution folder (extracted iso, copied dvd/usb)  
Distribution Drive (virtual mounted iso, inserted dvd, usb drive)  
WIM file directly (unmounted)

* Supports having updates in one folder:  
> Detect and install servicing stack update first  
Skip installing non-winpe updates for boot.wim/winre.wim (flash, oobe, .net 4.x)  
Skip installing Adobe Flash update for Server Core or if the package is removed  
Handle dynamic updates for setup media 'sources' folder (skip installing it, extract it for distribution target)

* Enable .NET Framework 3.5 if available source detected, and reinstall Cumulative updates afterwards.  
valid locations: mounted iso, inserted dvd/usb, sxs folder for distribution target, custom specified folder path

* Detect Windows ADK [Deployment Tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/get-started/adk-install) for offline integration

* Perform pending cleanup operation for online OS after restarting.  
you must run W10UI.cmd at least once after restart to perform Cleanup or Reset OS image, before installing any new updates

## Updated ISO recommendation:

* Creating updated iso file for a distribution target require either of:  
> install Windows ADK  
place oscdimg.exe or cdimage.exe in the same folder next to W10UI.cmd  
otherwise, embedded Powershell/.NET funcion `DIR2ISO` will be used to create the iso

## Limitations:

* Updates version will not be checked for applicability  
meaning for example, if 10240 updates are specified for 10586 target, the script will proceed to install them  
be sure to specify the correct updates files

* These extra updates are not processed correctly

[Remote Server Administration Tools (RSAT)](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2693643/)  
[Media Feature Pack for Windows N editions](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3145500/)

the script will try to install them whether applicable, already installed or not  
avoid using them with the script and install them manually

## How to:

* Recommended Host OS: Windows 8.1 or later

* Updating offline images of Windows 11 builds 22567 and later, require at least Windows 10 v1607 Host OS

* Optional: place W10UI.cmd next to the updates (.msu/.cab) to detect them by default

* Run the script as administrator

* Change the options to suit your needs, make sure all are set correctly, do not use quotes marks "" in paths

* Press zero '0' to start the process

* At the end, Press 9 or q to exit, or close the windows with red X button

## Options:

Press each option corresponding number/letter to change it

**1.** Target  
target windows image, default is current online system  
if a wim file is available besides the script, it will be detected automatically

**2.** Updates  
location of updates files

**3.** DISM  
the path for custom dism.exe  
required when the current Host OS is lower than Windows NT 10.0 without ADK installed

**4.** Enable .NET 3.5  
process or skip enabling .NET 3.5 feature

**5.** Cleanup System Image: YES      **6.** Reset Image Base: NO  
in this choice, the OS images will be cleaned and superseded components will be "delta-compressed"  
safe operation, but might take long time to complete.

**5.** Cleanup System Image: YES      **6.** Reset Image Base: YES  
in this choice, the OS images will be rebased and superseded components will be "removed"  
quick operation and reduce size further more, but might break "Reset this PC" feature.

**7.** Update WinRE.wim  
available only if the target is a distribution folder, or WIM file  
enable or disable updating winre.wim inside install.wim

**7.** Selected Install.wim indexes  
available only if the target is a distribution folder, or WIM file  
a choice to select specific index(s) to update from install.wim, or all indexes by default

**K.** Keep indexes  
available only if you selected specific index(s) in above option 8  
a choice to only keep selected index(s) when rebuilding install.wim, or keep ALL indexes

**M.** Mount Directory  
available only if the target is a distribution folder, or WIM file  
mount directory for updating wim files, default is on the same drive as the script

**E.** Extraction Directory  
directory for temporary extracted files, default is on the same drive as the script

## Configuration options (for advanced users):

- Edit W10UI.ini to change the default value of the main options:  
> Target  
Repo  
DismRoot  
Net35  
Cleanup  
ResetBase  
WinRE  
_CabDir  
MountDir

or set extra manual options below:

* Net35Source  
specify custom "folder" path which contain microsoft-windows-netfx3-ondemand-package.cab

* LCUwinre  
force updating winre.wim with Cumulative Update even if SafeOS update detected

* UpdtBootFiles  
update ISO boot files bootmgr/bootmgr.efi/efisys.bin from Cumulative Update

* SkipEdge  
1 = do not install EdgeChromium with Enablement Package or Cumulative Update  
2 = alternative workaround to skip EdgeChromium with Cumulative Update only

* wim2esd  
convert install.wim to install.esd, if the target is a distribution  
warning: the process will consume very high amount of CPU and RAM resources

* wim2swm  
split install.wim into multiple install.swm files, if the target is a distribution  
note: if both wim2esd/wim2swm are 1, install.esd takes precedence over split install.swm

* ISO  
create new iso file, if the target is a distribution folder  

* ISODir  
folder path for iso file, leave it blank to create in the script current directory

* Delete_Source  
keep or delete DVD distribution folder after creating updated ISO

* AutoStart  
start the process automatically once you execute the script  
the option will also auto exit at the end without prompt

* UseWimlib  
detect and use wimlib-imagex.exe for exporting wim files instead dism.exe

* AddDrivers  
add drivers to install.wim and boot.wim / winre.wim  
> this is basic feature support, and should be used only with tested working compatible drivers.  
it is ment for simple and boot critical drivers (chipsets, disk controllers, LAN/WiFi..), to allow easier installation, not for large drivers, or drivers that may break setup.  
it will not check or verify drivers, it simply point DISM towards the drivers folders.

How To Use:

enable "AddDrivers" option

place the drivers you want to add inside the proper subfolder:  
> ALL   / drivers will be added to all wim files  
OS    / drivers will be added to install.wim only  
WinPE / drivers will be added to boot.wim / winre.wim only

* Drv_Source  
optional, specify different source folder path for drivers  
the folder must contain subfolder for each drivers target, as explained above.

- Note: Do not change the structure of W10UI.ini, just set your options after the equal sign `=`

- To restore old behavior and change options by editing the script, simply detele W10UI.ini file

## Debug Mode (for advanced users):

* Create a log file of the integration process for debugging purposes

* The operation progress will not be shown in this mode

* How To:  
> edit the script and change set _Debug=0 to 1  
set main manual options correctly, specially "target" and "repo"  
save and run the script as admin  
wait until command prompt window is closed and W10UI_Debug.log is created
