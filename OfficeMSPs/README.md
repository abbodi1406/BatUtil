# Organize Office MSP Updates

* Extract and prepare Office msp files from global exe/cab update files to a folder with meaningful names.

* The MSP files will be renamed with prefix `Y_` or `Z_` followed by the package name, KB ID, Arch and MSP file name.

## Variables:

- "dirOfEXE" the path to parent office updates folder

- "dirOfMSP" extracted MSP files path, default is 'MSPs' folder next to the script

- "OldMSPdir" Folder to move old MSP versions, default is 'OLD' inside dirOfMSP

- "langOfMSP" language files to keep. Leaving it empty will keep all langs.

- "ProofLang" comma separated companion proofing languages. Leaving it empty will keep all proof msp files.

## Remark

After the process is completed, manually delete msp files that have newer similar files (based on timestamps)
